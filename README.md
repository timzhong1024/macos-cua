# macos-cua

`macos-cua` is a macOS-only low-level computer-use runtime for agents.

Its default path is simple:

- coordinates are absolute
- coordinates are window-first
- stdout is human-readable by default

## Install

Build locally:

```bash
swift build
```

Run with either:

```bash
swift run macos-cua <command>
```

or:

```bash
./.build/debug/macos-cua <command>
```

## Authorize

`macos-cua` needs two standard macOS permissions:

- `Accessibility` for mouse, keyboard, and window actions
- `Screen Recording` for screenshots

First check readiness:

```bash
swift run macos-cua doctor
```

Then start the built-in onboarding flow:

```bash
swift run macos-cua onboard
```

If you are running in a terminal and want it to wait for you:

```bash
swift run macos-cua onboard --wait --timeout 180
```

## Happy Path

Daily use should start with absolute coordinates.

1. Inspect the current coordinate space:

```bash
swift run macos-cua state
```

2. Capture the frontmost window:

```bash
swift run macos-cua screenshot /tmp/frontmost.png
```

3. Or Capture a region in the active coordinate space:

```bash
swift run macos-cua screenshot --region 100 100 300 200 /tmp/region.png
```

4. Move and click with absolute coordinates:

```bash
swift run macos-cua move 800 400 --precise
swift run macos-cua click 800 400 --fast
```

5. Use screen-global coordinates only when needed:

```bash
swift run macos-cua screenshot --screen /tmp/screen.png
swift run macos-cua move 800 400 --screen --precise
swift run macos-cua click 800 400 --screen --fast
```

## Dense UI Fallback

When a page is visually dense and the target is a small icon, URL, or toolbar
item, treat `screenshot --region` as the fallback inspection step instead of
guessing a final click from the full screenshot alone.

Recommended pattern:

1. Capture the full frontmost window for global context.
2. Take a second local crop tightly around the likely target area.
3. Re-read the local crop, then issue the final click.

Example:

```bash
swift run macos-cua screenshot /tmp/frontmost.png
swift run macos-cua screenshot --region 720 88 220 96 /tmp/toolbar-crop.png
swift run macos-cua click 812 132 --fast
```

## Model Resolution

Use absolute coordinates when your screenshot can be consumed at full useful resolution by the model. If the image must be resized or compressed before inference, switch to the relative-mode workflow in the docs.

As of 2026-04-18, public vendor docs indicate the following:

| Model | Documented vision resolution support |
| --- | --- |
| [`gpt-5.4`](https://developers.openai.com/api/docs/models/gpt-5.4) | Up to 6000 px max dimension with `detail: "original"`; 2048 px max dimension with `detail: "high"`. |
| [`gpt-5.4-mini`](https://developers.openai.com/api/docs/models/gpt-5.4-mini) | Up to 2048 px max dimension with `detail: "high"`. |
| [Claude Opus 4.7](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/build-with-claude/vision) | Up to 2576 px on the long edge. |
| [Claude Sonnet 4.5 / 4.6 and other current Claude vision models](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/build-with-claude/vision) | Up to 1568 px on the long edge. See the [relative-mode workflow](docs/README.md#relative-mode-and-resized-images). |

Older or weaker vision models are not recommended for coordinate-driven desktop control.
